Day 4 – CRUD Operations with SQLModel/SQLAlchemy (DB integration)
Day 5 – Pagination & Filtering for Large Data Sets
Day 6 – Response Models & Custom Response Formats (standardizing API responses)
Day 7 – Error Handling & Exception Middleware (custom exceptions for better UX)
Day 8 – File Upload & Download API (handling CSV/Excel/PDF uploads)
Day 9 – Dependency Injection in FastAPI (DB connections, config, security)
Day 10 – Environment Variables & Config Management with Pydantic Settings



Phase 2 — Authentication, Security & Middleware (Days 11–18)
