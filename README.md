# 🚀 FastAPI Mastery – Learn FastAPI from Scratch to Deployment

Welcome to **FastAPI Mastery**, a carefully crafted repository where I’ve documented my journey of mastering FastAPI. This project is built from the ground up — covering the core concepts, advanced features, real-world practices, and deployment techniques to help developers become confident FastAPI practitioners.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- ✅ Build and run robust FastAPI applications
- ✅ Understand RESTful API design with FastAPI
- ✅ Implement SQLModel ORM and database operations
- ✅ Master authentication and authorization (JWT, OAuth2, RBAC)
- ✅ Add production-grade middleware and background task processing
- ✅ Enable email services and account verification
- ✅ Perform unit and integration testing
- ✅ Deploy FastAPI applications to the cloud
